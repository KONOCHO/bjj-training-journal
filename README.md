CSS Layouts (Choose One Technique Per Project)

BJJ/MMA Fight Card
    Float: Design a classic fight card layout with side-by-side fighter images, names, records.
    Grid:  A modern fight card with more sections (bio, matchup analysis, etc.)
    Flexbox: A card that emphasizes the main event and neatly stacks undercard fights.

Boba Shop Menu
    Float: Traditional side-by-side columns for drink categories
    Grid: Image-focused grid of flavors with name/description overlays.
    Flexbox: Emphasize featured drinks while allowing other categories to flow neatly.

D&D Character Sheet 
    Positioning:  Create a "floating" character sheet with attribute blocks positioned neatly.
    Display & Box Model: Make visually distinct sections for abilities, inventory, backstory, with well-defined padding/margins.

CSS Responsive Design

 Adapt ANY of the Above! Focus on a key project from each section and apply these concepts:

    Media Queries: Adjust the layout to stack elements or change font sizes for smaller screens (phones, tablets).
    Fluid Images: Make sure images scale proportionally to fit different screen sizes.
    Flexible Units: Use percentages or viewport units (`vw`/`vh`) instead of fixed pixels for elements where possible.  

Additional Tips:

 Inspiration: Look up existing websites related to your interests for layout and style ideas.
 Color Schemes: Pick colors that fit your theme (earthy for BJJ, vibrant for Boba, fantasy-themed for D&D).
 Google Fonts: Spice things up with free, interesting fonts.
